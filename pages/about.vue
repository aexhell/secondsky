                  The beginning of my story goes back to 2014, when I was close to turning 9 years old. Due to the series of video games I played and the cliffhangers they left behind, I would get the urge to pick up where they left off on my own.
                  And that's how I started programming in <a href="https://gamemaker.io/">YoYoGames' GameMaker 1.2</a>, using the Drag and Drop language but then slowly transitioning to GML. Surely, these games were never popular in the slightest, I just made them to entertain myself.
                  <br><br>
                  By 2018 I had already lost interest in video game development, apart from the fact that the games I liked had already received a sequel, game development is not that easy.
                  The type of games I wanted to make required a <b>higher degree of programming</b> than I had, plus being the only member of the "team", there was no talent in music or art, so I left the programming field inside my memories.

                  Due to my abandonment of development field, I was once again a player in the communities to which I belonged. Because of this, I joined <b>Wikia</b> (currently <a href="https://www.fandom.com/">Fandom</a>) in the same year of 2018. Surprisingly, Wikia taught me a <i>new</i> field of programming: <b>web development</b>.
                  In Wikia I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JS, awakening again my desire to create but focused on this field that I had found. During the following year and 2019 I would start creating small websites, always focused on design and layout.
                  In 2020, I started using the <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue framework</a>, creating more ambitious projects. With what I learned, my first attempt at a serious project was to create an IRC desktop web application, called <b>Moon</b>, by merging Vue with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>.

                  This project remained on hiatus because although I know front-end, my back-end knowledge is very poor. And even though I've been learning more, my knowledge of the front-end is still considerably higher than the back-end, and although it seems ironic I really like both.
                  Moon had many more attempts to be recoded as he learned something new but to this day nothing concrete has come of it. In August 2021 I started volunteering for the Puroto project. <a href="https://sktd.me/">A friend of mine</a> invited me to the team within the front-end section in development.
                  My stay in the project lasted three months (December 2021) due to discussions among the team, but I learned more about web development in general.
                  <br><br>
                  My most recent project is <a href="https://mylium.app/">Mylium</a>. Mylium was my attempt at a social network after Puroto. Mylium is considerably the successor to Moon, because, like Moon, Mylium is made for fun, so its development is only progressed when I feel like doing it.
                  And that only happens very rarely. Including the rest of the projects I have. Including this very website. This only happens on my own projects though.
